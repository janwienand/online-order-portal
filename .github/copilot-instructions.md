# Copilot instructions

## How work starts here

This repository uses spec-driven development. Features begin as a specification in
`specs/`, not as a chat message. The commands `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`,
`/speckit.tasks` and `/speckit.implement` are available in Copilot Chat.

`.specify/memory/constitution.md` holds the principles that govern every change. Read it
before planning or implementing. It is not optional context.

## Security guidance

This repository has security guidance available to you. Use it — do not wait to be asked.

## Before proposing a commit, a push, or a pull request

Run a security review of the change you just made, using the skill in
`.github/skills/fortify-change-review/`. Read `SKILL.md` first, then the reference files
under `references/` that match what the change actually touches.

Report findings the way the skill defines them: category, severity, the exact file and
line, why it is exploitable, and the concrete fix. If a change is clean, say so plainly
rather than inventing findings.

## Dependencies

When adding, upgrading or replacing a dependency, check it against policy before writing
it into the build file. Look the component up before you commit to a version and prefer a
release without known vulnerabilities, without a restrictive licence and with an active
maintainer base. If you cannot check it, state that the component has not been checked
rather than assuming it is fine. The binding evaluation happens in the pipeline, not here.

## What this review is and is not

This is a fast local check that catches the obvious things before they leave the machine.
It does **not** replace the pipeline. The authoritative analysis runs in GitHub Actions
(SAST and SCA) and publishes to the Security tab. Never describe a change as "secure"
because this review passed — describe it as "no issues found in this review".

## Repository specifics

- Java 17, Spring Boot, Maven. Application code lives under `src/main/java/com/microfocus/example/`.
- This application contains **deliberately vulnerable code** for demonstration purposes.
  Do not silently "fix" existing vulnerabilities you were not asked to touch — they are the
  subject matter. Only review and fix the change currently being made.
- `EXPLOITS.md` documents the intentional weaknesses.
